# Implementation Plan: CaféOS Tablet APK (Native Android)

Create a standalone Android APK for tablets implementing the core POS, Inventory, and Product management features with a premium, minimal design. This app will run entirely offline using a local SQLite database that matches the CaféOS schema.

## User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This plan proposes a **Native Android App (Jetpack Compose)** rather than a web-wrapper (Capacitor). This ensures a "premium" feel and avoids the complexities of embedding a Node.js server and Prisma engine on Android, which is notoriously difficult to set up quickly.
